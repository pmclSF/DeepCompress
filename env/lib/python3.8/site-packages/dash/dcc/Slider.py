class Slider(Component):
    """A Slider component.
    A slider component with a single handle.

    Keyword arguments:

    - min (number; optional):
        Minimum allowed value of the slider.

    - max (number; optional):
        Maximum allowed value of the slider.

    - step (number; optional):
        Value by which increments or decrements are made.

    - marks (dict; optional):
        Marks on the slider. The key determines the position (a number),
        and the value determines what will show. If you want to set the
        style of a specific mark point, the value should be an object
        which contains style and label properties.

        `marks` is a dict with strings as keys and values of type string |
        dict with keys:

        - label (string; optional)

        - style (dict; optional)

    - value (number; optional):
        The value of the input.

    - drag_value (number; optional):
        The value of the input during a drag.

    - disabled (boolean; optional):
        If True, the handles can't be moved.

    - dots (boolean; optional):
        When the step value is greater than 1, you can set the dots to
        True if you want to render the slider with dots.

    - included (boolean; optional):
        If the value is True, it means a continuous value is included.
        Otherwise, it is an independent value.

    - tooltip (dict; optional):
        Configuration for tooltips describing the current slider value.

        `tooltip` is a dict with keys:

        - always_visible (boolean; optional):
            Determines whether tooltips should always be visible (as
            opposed to the default, visible on hover).

        - placement (a value equal to: 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom', 'topLeft', 'topRight', 'bottomLeft', 'bottomRight'; optional):
            Determines the placement of tooltips See
            https://github.com/react-component/tooltip#api top/bottom{*}
            sets the _origin_ of the tooltip, so e.g. `topLeft` will in
            reality appear to be on the top right of the handle.

        - template (string; optional):
            Template string to display the tooltip in. Must contain
            `{value}`, which will be replaced with either the default
            string representation of the value or the result of the
            transform function if there is one.

        - style (dict; optional):
            Custom style for the tooltip.

        - transform (string; optional):
            Reference to a function in the `window.dccFunctions`
            namespace. This can be added in a script in the asset folder.
            For example, in `assets/tooltip.js`: ``` window.dccFunctions =
            window.dccFunctions || {}; window.dccFunctions.multByTen =
            function(value) {     return value * 10; } ``` Then in the
            component `tooltip={'transform': 'multByTen'}`.

    - updatemode (a value equal to: 'mouseup', 'drag'; default 'mouseup'):
        Determines when the component should update its `value` property.
        If `mouseup` (the default) then the slider will only trigger its
        value when the user has finished dragging the slider. If `drag`,
        then the slider will update its value continuously as it is being
        dragged. If you want different actions during and after drag,
        leave `updatemode` as `mouseup` and use `drag_value` for the
        continuously updating value.

    - vertical (boolean; optional):
        If True, the slider will be vertical.

    - verticalHeight (number; default 400):
        The height, in px, of the slider if it is vertical.

    - className (string; optional):
        Additional CSS class for the root DOM node.

    - id (string; optional):
        The ID of this component, used to identify dash components in
        callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components
        in an app.

    - loading_state (dict; optional):
        Object that holds the loading state object coming from
        dash-renderer.

        `loading_state` is a dict with keys:

        - is_loading (boolean; optional):
            Determines if the component is loading or not.

        - prop_name (string; optional):
            Holds which property is loading.

        - component_name (string; optional):
            Holds the name of the component that is loading.

    - persistence (boolean | string | number; optional):
        Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted
        when the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is
        truthy and hasn't changed from its previous value, a `value` that
        the user has changed while using the app will keep that change, as
        long as the new `value` also matches what was given originally.
        Used in conjunction with `persistence_type`.

    - persisted_props (list of a value equal to: 'value's; default ['value']):
        Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing
        the component or the page. Since only `value` is allowed this prop
        can normally be ignored.

    - persistence_type (a value equal to: 'local', 'session', 'memory'; default 'local'):
        Where persisted user changes will be stored: memory: only kept in
        memory, reset on page refresh. local: window.localStorage, data is
        kept after the browser quit. session: window.sessionStorage, data
        is cleared once the browser quit."""
